Which is an interesting data set you discovered recently? Why is it your favorite? No datasets on Kaggle, please.

Ans: One interesting dataset that I recently discovered is the Earthdata by NASA provides access to a wide variety of 
earth science data from NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). EOSDIS manages data from 
various satellite and ground-based missions, providing observations and measurements of the Earth's atmosphere, oceans,
land surface, and cryosphere.
One of the benefits of Earthdata by NASA datasets is the range of scientific applications they can be used for, such as 
climate modeling, weather forecasting, land cover mapping, and disaster response. The datasets are also often updated 
frequently, which allows for monitoring of changes over time.
To use these datasets, researchers and scientists can access them through the Earthdata Search interface, which allows 
for searching and filtering datasets based on parameters such as date range, location, and data type. The data can then 
be downloaded in various formats, such as netCDF or HDF, and used for analysis or visualization using tools such as Python libraries.
