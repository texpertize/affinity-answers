The following questions test your aptitude for interacting with databases.The questions are based off 
the following public SQL DB: docs.rfam.org/en/latest/database.html

a. How many types of tigers can be found in the taxonomy table of the dataset? 
What is the "ncbi_id" of the Sumatran Tiger? (hint: use the biological name of the tiger)

Ans: 

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT species) AS num_tigers, ncbi_id
FROM taxonomy
WHERE genus = 'Panthera' AND species LIKE '%tigris%'
GROUP BY ncbi_id;

This query will return the number of unique tiger species found in the taxonomy table, as well as 
the ncbi_id of each species.

b. Find all the columns that can be used to connect the tables in the given database.

We need to find all the columns that are present in multiple tables and can be used to join them. 
We can do this by querying the information_schema database.

SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) as num_tables
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'rfam'
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY num_tables DESC, column_name ASC;

This query will return a list of all the columns that are present in more than one table, 
along with the number of tables each column is present in. We can use these columns to 
connect the tables in the database.
