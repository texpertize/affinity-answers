"""Problem: Imagine there is a file full of Twitter tweets by various users and you are provided a set of words that indicates racial slurs. Write a program that can indicate the degree of profanity for each sentence in the file. Write in any programming language (preferably in Python) - make any assumptions, but remember to state them."""

"""Assumptions:
The file containing tweets is a text file, with one tweet per line.
The set of racial slurs is provided in a text file, with one slur per line.
The racial slurs file is named "racial_slurs.txt" and is located in the 
same directory as the program file.
The tweets file is named "tweets.txt" and is located in the same directory as 
the program file.
The program should output a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the tweet and 
its degree of profanity, sorted in descending order of profanity."""
